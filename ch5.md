# CHAPTER 5 - The Network Layer: Control Plane

## 5.1 Introduction //389 in text
- discuss the formulation of the network control plane
- how are forwarding and flow tables are computed, maintain, and installed
- each router on a network communicates with others to develop this table
- Logically Centeralized Control, sets up assigning ip addresses, loadsharing, NAT and other stuff
- controller talks with Control Agent(CA) to configure each routers flow table

## 5.2 Routing Algorithms
- Routing Algorithms determine good paths(routes) from senders to recievers, good having the lowest cost
- rules can also forbid ceartin nodes in a path
- graph $G=(N,E)$ where $N \rarr $ nodes ; $E \rarr$ edges
