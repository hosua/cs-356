<p>6Q:According to the following cwnd graph, we agree that it is completely possible that the transmission round(s) within which the connection experiences a triple-duplicated-ack event are 20, 25, 31
<img src="6.png" alt="Alt text" title="question"><br>
A: False<br>
Explanation:
at T=20 we can see window size is reduced from 24 to 2. But in case of triple duplicate ack window should become half of cwnd means it should become 12 not 2.</p>
<p>For T=25 it is falling from 8 to 6 which is not half of 8(cwnd). So it is not triple duplicate ack event.</p>
<p>For T=31 it is leniarly increasing. so there will be no fall and duplicate acks.</p>
<p>So finally answer is false because for answer true all must be triple duplicate ack.</p>

<img src="10.png" alt="Alt text" title="question"><br>

<p>12Q:Based on the provided graph following TCP Reno, enter the transmission round(s) within which the connection experiences a time-out event in ascending order. Separate each round number with a ',' without space. No comma should follow the last entry. If no transmission round applies, enter '0'. Initial ssthresh = 8.<br>
<img src="12.png" alt="Alt text" title="question"><br>
A:21,34<br>
Explanation:</p>
<p>In case of timeout, congestion window size drops to 1 and TCP enters in slow start phase again.</p>
<p>Here total number of time window size drops to 1 is 2</p>
<p>Thus transmission round during which timeout occured is 21,34</p>

<p>13Q:Based on the provided graph following TCP Reno, enter the transmission round(s) within which the connection is in Fast Recovery phase in ascending order. Separate each round number with a ',' without space. No comma should follow the last entry. If no transmission round applies, enter '0'. Initial ssthresh = 8.<br>
<img src="13.png" alt="Alt text" title="question"><br>
A: 8,15,31<br>
Explanation:\</p>
<p>Congestion window size decreases rapidly during this period and grows linearly as the situation improves. Triple acknowledgment causes TCP to enter a rapid recovery mode. The value of the window decreases at around eight and then grows linearly afterward, as seen in the figure. Thus, the rapid recovery phase is 8,15,31 minutes.</p>

And how many RTTs will you need to get the entire web page displayed? Type your answer in the order of the question asked, separated by a comma, no unit of measurement should be used, no space<br>
A:idk how she wants it typed
Explanation:\</p>
<p>Following is the sequencing, happening at each RTT :</p>
<pre><code>t = 0 to RTT-1 :
    TCP-1 is opened (with 1st server).
t = RTT-1 to RTT-2 :
    Webpage is fetched using TCP-1.
t = RTT-2 to RTT-3 :
    It is found that the webpage references three images.
    First image is fetched via TCP-1.
    TCP-1 is closed.
    TCP-2 is opened (with 2nd server).
    TCP-3 is opened (with 3rd server)
t = RTT-3 to RTT-4 :
    Second image is fetched via TCP-2.
    TCP-2 is closed.

<p>44Q:Based on the provided graph following TCP Reno, enter the transmission round(s) within which the connection experiences a triple-duplicated-ack event in ascending order. Separate each round number with a ',' without space. No comma should follow the last entry. If no transmission round applies, enter '0'. Initial ssthresh = 8.<br>
<img src="44.png" alt="Alt text" title="question"><br>
A:Whenever a transmission experiences a triple-duplicate ACK event, the sender/transmitter reduces the congestion window by a predefined limit and the transmission enters a congestion-avoidance phase. In the congestion-avoidance phase, the congestion window is increased by a value of 1 MSS(max. Segment Size) after each successful acknowledgement received from the receiver. Hence, in the congestion-avoidance phase, the graph will increase linearly.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the given graph:
Here, we can see that the congestion window reduces between the following transmission ranges, followed by a congestion-avoidance phase:</p>

2. 13 to 15 and
3. 29 to 31

<p>45Q:Based on the provided graph following TCP Reno, enter the transmission round(s) within which the connection is in Fast Recovery phase in ascending order. Separate each round number with a ',' without space. No comma should follow the last entry. If no transmission round applies, enter '0'. Initial ssthresh = 8.<br>

A:8,15,31
Explanation:-</p>
<p>Congestion window size decreases rapidly during this period and grows linearly as the situation improves. Triple acknowledgment causes TCP to enter a rapid recovery mode. The value of the window decreases at around eight and then grows linearly afterward, as seen in the figure. Thus, the rapid recovery phase is 8,15,31 minutes.</p>

<li>I can use SSH to secure all connections initiated from the Git remote repository via a three-way handshake.</li>
<li><strong>I can use SSH as a cryptographic network protocol to communicate over the network to clone a repository or make an update to one. This has two benefits: no repetitive authentication potential (i.e. with setup of key pairs) thus saving time, and my connection is secure.</strong></li>

<p>47Q:The router is performing UDP Checksum. It receives the following data: 10101010 10101010 11110000 11110000. Enter the expected checksum.<br>
A: 0110010001100100
Explanation:\</p>
<p>The checksum is a simple method and not so complex to detect an error but the probability to detect error is low as compared to the CRC method.</p>
<p>UDP header uses the 16-bit checksum and it is used to detect the error in the header of the UDP protocol message.</p>
<p>To calculate the checksum of 'n' bits, we divide the data into the segment of 'n' bits and then add all the segments. Finally, the sum is complemented by using one's complement to get the checksum.</p>
<p>The given 16-bit integer in binary format are:</p>
<pre><code>1010101010101010
1111000011110000
</code></pre>
<p>The sum of the given binary numbers is:</p>
<p>1010101010101010+1111000011110000 = 11001101110011010</p>
<p>Since the result consists of 16 bits only, but there are more than 16 bits in the result.</p>
<p>So extra bits are wrapped around.</p>
<p>The final sum is = 1001101110011011</p>
<p>The one's complement of the sum is = 0110010001100100</p>
<p>So, the checksum is = 0110010001100100</p>
