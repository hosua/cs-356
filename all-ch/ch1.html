COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-internet">1.1 What Is the Internet?</h2>
<h3 id="a-nuts-and-bolts-description">1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts
Description</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>End systems are connected together by a network of
<strong>communication links</strong> and <strong>packet
switches</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the
<strong>transmission rate</strong> of a link measured in
bits/second.</p></li>
<li><p>When one end system has data to send to another end system, the
sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each
segment (a.k.a <strong>packets</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Packet switches</strong> come in many shapes and flavors,
but the two most prominent types in today’s Internet are
<strong>routers</strong> and <strong>link-layer
switches</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a
<strong>route</strong> or <strong>path</strong> through the
network.</p></li>
<li><p>End systems access the Internet through <strong>Internet Service
Providers (ISPs)</strong>, including residential ISPs such as local
cable, telephone companies, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong> and the
<strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong> are two of the most important
protocols in the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as
<strong>TCP/IP</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internet standards</strong> are developed by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) [IETF 2020].</p></li>
<li><p>The IETF standards documents are called <strong>requests for
comments (RFCs)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RFCs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RFCs tend to be quite technical and detailed.</li>
<li>They define protocols such as <strong>TCP</strong>,
<strong>IP</strong>, <strong>HTTP</strong> (for the Web), and
<strong>SMTP</strong> (for e-mai).</li>
<li>There are currently nearly 9000 RFCs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-services-description">1.1.2 A Services Description</h3>
<ul>
<li>Internet applications include mobile smartphone and tablet
applications, including Internet messaging, mapping with real-time
road-traffic information, music streaming movie and television
streaming, online social media, video conferencing, multi-person games,
and location-based recommendation systems. The applications are said to
be <strong>distributed applications</strong>, since they involve
multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does one program running on one end system
instruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on
another end system?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> End systems attached to the Internet provide a
<strong>socket interface</strong> that specifies how a program running
on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a
specific destination program running on another end system.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are packet switching and TCP/IP?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Packet switching is: a mode of data transmission
in which a message is broken into a number of parts which are sent
independently, over whatever route is optimum for each packet, and
reassembled at the destination. TCP/IP is a protocol that uses packet
switching.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are routers?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A router is a device that connects two or more
packet-switched networks or subnetworks.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What kinds of communication links are present in
the Internet?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Links are made up of different types of physical
media: <strong>coaxial cable</strong>, <strong>copper wire</strong>,
<strong>fiber optics</strong>, and <strong>radio spectrum</strong>.
Different links can transmit data at different rates. The link
<strong>transmission rate</strong> is often called the <strong>link
bandwidth</strong>, and is typically measured in bits/second.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a distributed application?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A <strong>distributed application</strong>
consists of one or more local or remote clients that communicate with
one or more servers on several machines linked through a network.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-protocol">1.1.3 What is a Protocol?</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a protocol?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A <strong>protocol</strong> is an established set
of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different
devices in the same network.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does a protocol do?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A <strong>protocol</strong> defines the format
and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating
entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or
receipt of a message or other event.</p>
<h2 id="the-network-edge">1.2 The Network Edge</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The computers and other devices connected to the Internet are
often referred to as end systems.</p></li>
<li><p>They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge
of the Internet</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet’s end systems include desktop computers (e.g.,
desktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and e-mail
servers), and mobile devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, and
tablets).</p></li>
<li><p>End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that
is, run) application programs such as a Web browser program, a Web
server program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server
program.</p></li>
<li><p>Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories:
<strong>clients</strong> and <strong>servers</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, most of the servers from which we receive search results,
e-mail, Web pages, videos and mobile app content reside in large
<strong>data centers</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Data centers serve three purposes</p>
<ul>
<li>They serve Amazon e-commerce pages to users. For example, pages
describing products and purchase information.</li>
<li>They serve as massively parallel computing infrastructures for
Amazon-specific data processing tasks.</li>
<li>They provide <strong>cloud computing</strong> to other companies.
Indeed, today a major trend in computing is for companies to use a cloud
provider such as Amazon to handle essentially all of their IT
needs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-networks">1.2.1 Access Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access
are <strong>digital subscriber line (DSL)</strong> and cable.</li>
<li>Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP.</li>
<li>While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone
infrastructure, <strong>cable Internet access</strong> makes use of the
cable television company’s existing cable television
infrastructure.</li>
<li>Although DSL and cable networks currently represent the majority of
residential broadband access in the United States, an up-and-coming
technology that provides even higher speeds is <strong>fiber to the home
(FTTH)</strong> [Fiber Broadband 2020].</li>
<li>FTTH can potentially provide Internet access rates in the gigabits
per second range.</li>
<li>The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber,
with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber
leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not
until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into
individual customer-specific fibers.</li>
<li>There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures
that perform this splitting:
<ul>
<li>active optical networks (AONs)</li>
<li>passive optical networks (PONs) - Used by Verizon FiOS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home
settings, a <strong>local area network (LAN)</strong> is used to connect
an end system to the edge router.</li>
<li>Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access technology in
corporate, university, and home networks.</li>
<li>Ethernet users use <strong>twisted-pair</strong> copper wire to
connect to an Ethernet switch,</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physical-media">1.2.2 Physical Media</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coaxial cable</p></li>
<li><p>DSL and Ethernet use copper wire</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile access networks use the radio spectrum</p></li>
<li><p>When bits travel from their source to their destination, they
pass through a series of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each
transmitter-receiver pair, the bit is sent by propagating
electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a <strong>physical
medium</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of physical media</p>
<ul>
<li>twisted-pair copper wire</li>
<li>coaxial cable</li>
<li>multimode fiber-optic cable</li>
<li>terrestrial radio spectrum</li>
<li>satellite radio spectrum</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical media fall into two categories: <strong>guided
media</strong> and <strong>unguided media</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>many builders install twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial
cable in every room in a building</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="twisted-pair-copper-wire">Twisted-Pair Copper Wire</h4>
<ul>
<li>The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission
medium</li>
<li>More than 99 percent of the wired connections from the telephone
handset to the local telephone switch use twisted-pair copper wire</li>
<li>Twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires, each about 1 mm
thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern</li>
<li>The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interference
from similar pairs close by</li>
<li>A wire pair constitutes a single communication link</li>
<li><strong>Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)</strong> is commonly used for
computer networks within a building, that is, for LANs</li>
<li>Modern twisted-pair technology, such as category 6a cable, can
achieve data rates of 10 Gbps for distances up to a hundred meters</li>
<li>DSL (digital subscriber line) technology has enabled residential
users to access the Internet at tens of Mbps over twisted pair (when
users live close to the ISP’s central office)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="coaxial-cable">Coaxial Cable</h4>
<ul>
<li>Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors,
but the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel</li>
<li>With this construction and special insulation and shielding, coaxial
cable can achieve high data transmission rates</li>
<li>Cable television systems have recently been coupled with cable
modems to provide residential users with Internet access at rates of
hundreds of Mbps</li>
<li>Coaxial cable can be used as a <strong>guided shared
medium</strong></li>
<li>Specifically, a number of end systems can be connected directly to
the cable, with each of the end systems receiving whatever is sent by
the other end systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fiber-optics">Fiber Optics</h4>
<ul>
<li>An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of
light, with each pulse representing a bit</li>
<li>A single optical fiber can support tremendous bit rates, up to tens
or even hundreds of gigabits per second</li>
<li>They are immune to electromagnetic interference, have very low
signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers, and are very hard to tap</li>
<li>fiber optics are the preferred long-haul guided transmission media,
particularly for overseas links</li>
<li>The Optical Carrier (OC) standard link speeds range from 51.8 Mbps
to 39.8 Gbps</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="terrestrial-radio-channels">Terrestrial Radio Channels</h4>
<ul>
<li>Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum</li>
<li>Are an attractive medium because they require no physical wire to be
installed, can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user,
and can potentially carry a signal for long distances</li>
<li>trial radio channels can be broadly classified into three groups:
those that operate over very short distance (e.g., with one or two
meters); those that operate in local areas, typically spanning from ten
to a few hundred meters; and those that operate in the wide area,
spanning tens of kilometers</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="satellite-radio-channels">Satellite Radio Channels</h4>
<ul>
<li>A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave
transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations</li>
<li>The satellite receives transmissions on one frequency band,
regenerates the signal using a repeater</li>
<li>Two types of satellites are used in communications:
<strong>geostationary satellites</strong> and <strong>low-earth orbiting
(LEO)</strong> satellites</li>
<li>Satellite links, which can operate at speeds of hundreds of Mbps,
are often used in areas without access to DSL or cable-based Internet
access</li>
<li>There are currently many low-altitude communication systems in
development. LEO satellite technology may be used for Internet access
sometime in the future</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-network-core">1.3 The Network Core</h2>
<ul>
<li>Having examined the Internet’s edge, let us now delve more deeply
inside the network core–the mesh of packet switches and links that
interconnects the Internet’s <strong>end systems</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="packet-switching">1.3.1 Packet Switching</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a network application, end systems exchange
<strong>messages</strong> with each other</li>
<li>To send a message from a source end system to a destination
endsystem, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data
known as <strong>packets</strong></li>
<li>Between source and destination, each packet travels through
communication links and packet switches (for which there are two
predominant types, <strong>routers</strong> and <strong>link-layer
switches</strong>)</li>
<li>Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal
to the full transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end system or
a packet switch is sending a packet of <strong>L</strong> bits over a
link with transmission rate <strong>R</strong> bits/sec, then the time
to transmit the packet is <strong>L / R</strong> seconds</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="store-and-forward-transmission">Store-and-Forward
Transmission</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most packet switches use <strong>store-and-forward</strong>
transmission at the inputs to the links</li>
<li>Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must
receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit
of the packet onto the outbound link</li>
<li>At time <code>L/R</code> seconds, since the router has just received
the entire packet, it can begin to transmit the packet onto the outbound
link towards the destination</li>
<li>At time <code>2L/R</code>, the router has transmitted the entire
packet, and the entire packet has been received by the destination.
Thus, the total delay is <code>2L/R</code>.</li>
<li>If the switch instead forwarded bits as soon as they arrive (without
first receiving the entire packet), then the total delay would be
<code>L/R</code> since bits are not held up at the router.</li>
</ul>
<h4
id="calculate-the-amount-of-time-that-elapses-from-when-the-source-begins-to-send-the-first-packet-until-the-destination-has-received-all-three-packets">Calculate
the amount of time that elapses from when the source begins to send the
first packet until the destination has received all three packets:</h4>
<ul>
<li>At time <code>L/R</code>, the router begins to forward the first
packet</li>
<li>Simultaneously at time <code>L/R</code>, the source will begin to
send the second packet since it has just finished sending the entire
first packet</li>
<li>Thus, at time <code>2L/R</code>, the destination has received the
first packet and the router has received the second packet</li>
<li>Similarly, at time <code>3L/R</code>, the destination has received
the first two packets and the router has received the third packet</li>
<li>Finally, at time <code>4L/R</code> the destination has received all
three packets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="general-formula">General Formula:</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>L</code> = number of bits being sent</li>
<li><code>R</code> = transmission rate (bits/second)</li>
<li><code>N</code> = number of links available</li>
<li>dend-to-end (end-to-end delay) = <code>N(L/R)</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="queuing-delays-and-packet-loss">Queuing Delays and Packet
Loss</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it</li>
<li>For each attached link, the packet switch has an <strong>output
buffer</strong> (also called an <strong>output queue</strong>)</li>
<li>If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds
the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving
packet must wait in the output buffer</li>
<li>Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets suffer
output buffer <strong>queuing delays</strong></li>
<li>Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an arriving packet may
find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for
transmission</li>
<li>In this case, <strong>packet loss</strong> will occur–either the
arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be
dropped</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="forwarding-tables-and-routing-protocols">Forwarding Tables and
Routing Protocols</h4>
<ul>
<li>A router takes a packet arriving on one of its attached
communication links and forwards that packet onto another one of its
attached communication links</li>
<li>How does the router determine which link it should forward the
packet onto? Packet forwarding is actually done in different ways in
different types of computer networks.</li>
<li>In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP
address.</li>
<li>When a packet arrives at a router in the network, the router
examines a portion of the packet’s destination address and forwards the
packet to an adjacent router</li>
<li>Each router has a <strong>forwarding table</strong> that maps
destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that
router’s outbound links</li>
<li>When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the address
and searches its <strong>forwarding table</strong>, using this
destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link</li>
<li>The router then directs the packet to this outbound link</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do forwarding tables get set? Are they
configured by hand in each and every router, or does the Internet use a
more automated procedure?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> the Internet has a number of special routing
protocols that are used to automatically set the <strong>forwarding
tables</strong></p>
<h3 id="circuit-switching">1.3.2 Circuit Switching</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a
network of links and switches: <strong>circuit switching</strong> and
<strong>packet switching</strong></li>
<li>In <strong>circuit-switched networks</strong>, the resources needed
along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for
communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of
the communication session between the end systems</li>
<li>In <strong>packet-switched networks</strong>, these resources are
<strong>not</strong> reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on
demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait (that is, queue) for
access to a communication link</li>
<li>A <strong>circuit</strong> is the connection between the sender and
the receiver</li>
<li>When two hosts want to communicate, the network establishes a
dedicated <strong>end-to-end</strong> connection between the two
hosts.</li>
<li>Thus, in order for Host A to communicate with Host B, the network
must first reserve one circuit on each of two linksA</li>
<li>if each link between adjacent switches has a transmission rate of 1
Mbps and there are 4 links/switches, then each end-to-end circuit-switch
connection gets 250 kbps
<ul>
<li><code>1 Mbps = 10^6    1 Kbps = 10^3     (1*10^6)/4 = 250*10^3</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="multiplexing-in-circuit-switched-networks">Multiplexing in
Circuit-Switched Networks</h4>
<ul>
<li>A circuit in a link is implemented with either
<strong>frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)</strong> or
<strong>time-division multiplexing (TDM)</strong></li>
<li>With <strong>FDM</strong>, the frequency spectrum of a link is
divided up among the connections established across the link</li>
<li>Specifically, the link dedicates a frequency band to each connection
for the duration of the connection</li>
<li>This is where the term <strong>bandwith</strong> is derived from
width</li>
<li>For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and
each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots.</li>
<li>Proponents of packet switching have always argued that circuit
switching is wasteful because the dedicated circuits are idle during
<strong>silent periods</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Suppose that all links in the network use TDM
with <strong>24 slots</strong> and have a <strong>bit-rate of 1.536
Mbps</strong>. Also suppose that it takes <strong>500 ms</strong> to
establish an end-to-end circuit before Host A can begin to transmit the
file of size <strong>640kb</strong>. How long does it take to send the
file?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> each link speed =
<code>(1.536Mbps)/24 = 64000 = 64Kbps, 640kbps/64kb = 10 seconds</code></p>
<h3 id="a-network-of-networks">1.3.3 A Network of Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li>the access ISP is said to be a <strong>customer</strong> and the
global transit ISP is said to be a <strong>provider</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tier-1-isp">Tier-1 ISP:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>These ISPs are at the top of the hierarchy and they have a global
reach they do not pay for any internet traffic through their network
instead lower-tier ISPs have to pay a cost for passing their traffic
from one geolocation to another which is not under the reach of that
ISPs.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, ISPs at the same level connect to each other and allow
free traffic passes to each other. Such ISPs are called peers. Due to

Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks</h2>
<h3 id="overview-of-delay-in-packet-switched-networks">1.4.1 Overview of
Delay in Packet-Switched Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li>A packet starts in a host (the source), passes through a series of
routers, and ends its journey in another host (the destination)</li>
<li>The performance of many Internet applications–such as search,
Web-browsing, e-mail, maps, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP–are
greatly affected by network delays</li>
<li>As a packet travels from one node (host or router) to the subsequent
node (host or router) along this path, the packet suffers from several
types of delays at each node along the path</li>
<li>The most important of these delays are the <strong>nodal processing
delay</strong>, <strong>queuing delay</strong>, <strong>transmission
delay</strong>, and <strong>propagation delay</strong>; together, these
delays accumulate to give a <strong>total nodal delay</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="processing-delay">Processing Delay</h4>
<ul>
<li>The time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where
to direct the packet is part of the <strong>processing
delay</strong></li>
<li>The processing delay can also include other factors, such as the
time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred in
transmitting the packet’s bits from the upstream node to router A</li>
<li>Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically on the order
of microseconds or less</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="queuing-delay">Queuing Delay</h4>
<ul>
<li>At the queue, the packet experiences a <strong>queuing
delay</strong> as it waits to be transmitted onto the link</li>
<li>The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on
the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for
transmission onto the link</li>
<li>If the queue is empty and no other packet is currently being
transmitted, then our packet’s queuing delay will be zero</li>
<li>If the traffic is heavy and many other packets are also waiting to
be transmitted, the queuing delay will be long</li>
<li>Queuing delays can be on the order of microseconds to milliseconds
in practice</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="transmission-delay">Transmission Delay</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served
manner, as is common in packet-switched networks, our packet can be
transmitted only after all the packets that have arrived before it have
been transmitted</li>
<li>Denote the length of the packet by <code>L</code> bits</li>
<li>Denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B
by <code>R</code> bits/sec</li>
<li>For example, for a <code>10 Mbps</code> Ethernet link, the rate is
<code>R = 10 Mbps</code>; for a <code>100 Mbps</code> Ethernet link, the
rate is <code>R = 100 Mbps</code></li>
<li>The transmission delay is <code>L/R</code>. This is the amount of
time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into
the link</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="propagation-delay">Propagation Delay</h4>
<ul>
<li>The time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to
router B is the <strong>propagation delay</strong></li>
<li>The propagation speed depends on the physical medium of the link
(that is, fiber optics, twisted-pair copper wire, and so on) and is in
the range of 2<em>10^8 meter/sec to 3</em>10^8 meters/sec</li>
<li>This is equal to, or a little less than, the speed of light</li>
<li>The <strong>propagation delay</strong> is the
<strong>d</strong>istance between two routers divided by the propagation
<strong>s</strong>peed, so the propagation delay is
<strong>d/s</strong></li>
<li>Once the last bit of the packet propagates to node B, it and all the
preceding bits of the packet are stored in router B</li>
<li>In wide-area networks, propagation delays are on the order of
milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="comparing-tranmission-and-propagation-delay">Comparing
Tranmission and Propagation Delay</h4>
<ul>
<li>The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router
to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the
transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance
between the two routers</li>
<li>The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit
to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the
distance between the two routers, but has nothing to do with the
packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link</li>
<li>Let <strong>dproc</strong>, <strong>dqueue</strong>,
<strong>dtrans</strong>, and <strong>dprop</strong> denote the
processing, queuing, transmission, and propagation delays</li>
<li>then the total nodal delay is given by <strong>dnodal</strong> =
<strong>dproc</strong> + <strong>dqueue</strong> +
<strong>dtrans</strong> + <strong>dprop</strong></li>
<li>The contribution of these delay components can vary
significantly.</li>
<li>For example, <strong>dprop</strong> can be negligible (for example,
a couple of microseconds) for a link connecting two routers on the same
university campus</li>
<li>however, <strong>dprop</strong> is hundreds of milliseconds for two
routers interconnected by a geostationary satellite link, and can be the
dominant term in dnodal</li>
<li>Similarly, <strong>dtrans</strong> can range from negligible to
significant. Its contribution is typically negligible for transmission
rates of 10 Mbps and higher (for example, for LANs)</li>
<li>however, it can be hundreds of milliseconds for large Internet
packets sent over low-speed dial-up modem links</li>
<li>The processing delay, <strong>dproc</strong>, is often negligible;
however, it strongly influences a router’s maximum
<strong>throughput</strong> which is the maximum rate at which a router
can forward packets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="queuing-delay-and-packet-loss">1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet
Loss</h3>
<ul>
<li>The most complicated and interesting component of nodal delay is the
queuing delay, <strong>dqueue</strong></li>
<li>queuing delay is so important and interesting in computer networking
that thousands of papers and numerous books have been written about
it</li>
<li>Unlike the other three delays (<strong>dproc</strong>,
<strong>dtrans</strong>, and <strong>dprop</strong>), the queuing delay
can vary from packet to packet</li>
<li>For example, if 10 packets arrive at an empty queue simultaneously,
the first packet transmitted will suffer no queuing delay, while the
last packet will have to wait until the first 9 are done.</li>
<li>when characterizing queuing delay, one typically uses statistical
measures such as average queuing delay, variance of queuing delay, and
the probability that the queuing delay exceeds some specified
value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When is the queuing delay large and when is it
insignificant?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This question depends on the rate at which
traffic arrives at the queue, the transmission rate of the link, and the
nature of the arriving traffic.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>R</code> is the transmission rate (in bits/sec) at which bits
are pushed out of the queue</li>
<li>Also suppose, for simplicity, that all packets consist of
<code>L</code> bits</li>
<li>Then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is
<code>La</code> bits/sec</li>
<li>The ratio <code>La/R</code>, called the
<code>traffic intensity</code></li>
<li>If <code>La/R &gt; 1</code>, then the average rate at which bits
arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be
transmitted from the queue</li>
<li>Therefore, one of the golden rules in traffic engineering is: Design
your system so that the traffic intensity is no greater than 1</li>
<li>Now consider the case <code>La/R &lt;= 1</code> Here, the nature of
the arriving traffic impacts the queuing delay.</li>
<li>For example, if packets arrive periodically–that is, one packet
arrives every <code>L/R</code> seconds–then every packet will arrive at
an empty queue and there will be no queuing delay</li>
<li>On the other hand, if packets arrive in bursts but periodically,
there can be a significant average queuing delay</li>
<li>For example, suppose <strong>N</strong> packets arrive
simultaneously every <code>(L/R)N</code> seconds</li>
<li>The first packet transmitted has no queuing delay; the second packet
transmitted has a queuing delay of L/R seconds; the nth packet
transmitted has a queuing delay of <code>(n - 1)L/R</code> secs</li>
<li>If the traffic intensity is close to zero, then packet arrivals are
few and far between and it is unlikely that an arriving packet will find
another packet in the queue. Hence, the average queuing delay will be
close to zero</li>
<li>When the traffic intensity is close to 1, there will be intervals of
time when the arrival rate exceeds the transmission capacity (due to
variations in packet arrival rate), and a queue will form during these
periods of time</li>
<li>When the arrival rate is less than the transmission capacity, the
length of the queue will shrink.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="packet-loss">Packet Loss</h4>
<ul>
<li>A queue preceding a link has finite capacity, although the queuing
capacity greatly depends on the router design and cost</li>
<li>Because the queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not really
approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches 1</li>
<li>Instead, a packet can arrive to find a full queue. With no place to
store such a packet.</li>
<li>A router will <strong>drop</strong> this packet, resulting in
<strong>packet loss</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="end-to-end-delay">1.4.3 End-to-End Delay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Suppose there are N - 1 routers between the source host and
destination host.</li>
<li>Suppose that the network is uncongested (so that queuing delays are
negligible), the processing delay at each router and at the source host
is <strong>dproc</strong></li>
<li>Suppose the transmission rate out of each router and out of the
source host is <strong>R</strong> bits/sec</li>
<li>And suppose the propagation on each link is
<strong>dprop</strong></li>
<li><code>dend - end = N (dproc + dtrans + dprop)</code></li>
<li>The nodal delays accumulate and give an <strong>end-to-end</strong>
delay where, once again, <code>dtrans = L/R</code>, where <code>L</code>
is the packet size</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="traceroute">Traceroute</h4>
<ul>
<li>Traceroute is a simple program that can run in any Internet
host.</li>
<li>When the user specifies a destination hostname, the program in the
source host sends multiple, special packets toward that destination</li>
<li>As these packets work their way toward the destination, they pass
through a series of routers.</li>
<li>When a router receives one of these special packets, it sends back
to the source a short message that contains the name and address of the
router.</li>
<li>The output has six columns: the first column is the n value
described above, that is, the number of the router along the route</li>
<li>the second column is the name of the router</li>
<li>the third column is the address of the router (of the form
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)</li>
<li>the last three columns are the round-trip delays for three
experiments</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="end-system-application-and-other-delays">End System,
Application, and Other Delays</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to processing, transmission, and propagation delays,
there can be additional significant delays in the end systems</li>
<li>For example, an end system wanting to transmit a packet into a
shared medium (e.g., as in a WiFi or cable modem scenario) may
purposefully delay its transmission as part of its protocol for sharing
the medium with other end systems</li>
<li>Another important delay is media packetization delay, which is
present in Voice-over-IP (VoIP) applications</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="throughput-in-computer-networks">1.4.4 Throughput in Computer
Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In addition to delay and packet loss, another critical
performance measure in computer networks is end-to-end
throughput</p></li>
<li><p>To define throughput, consider transferring a large file from
Host A to Host B across a computer network</p></li>
<li><p>This transfer might be, for example, a large video clip from one
computer to another</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>instantaneous throuput</strong> at any instant of
time is the rate (in bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the
file</p></li>
<li><p>If the file consists of <strong>F</strong> bits and the transfer
takes <strong>T</strong> seconds for Host B to receive all
<strong>F</strong> bits, then the average throughput of the file
transfer is <strong>F/T</strong> bits/sec</p></li>
<li></li>
<li><p>Consider the throughput for a file transfer from the server to
the client</p></li>
<li><p>Let <code>Rs</code> denote the rate of the link between the
server and the router</p></li>
<li><p>Let <code>Rc</code> denote the rate of the link between the
router and the client</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the only bits being sent in the entire network are
those from the server to the client</p></li>
<li><p>What is the server-to-client throughput?</p></li>
<li><p>The server cannot pump bits through its link at a rate faster
than <code>Rs</code> bps</p></li>
<li><p>The router cannot forward bits at a rate faster than Rc
bps.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>Rs &lt; Rc</code>, then the bits pumped by the server
will â€œflow” right through the router and arrive at the client at a
rate of <code>Rs</code> bps, giving a throughput of <code>Rs</code>
bps</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>Rs &gt; Rc</code>, then the router will not be able to
forward bits as quickly as it receives them</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, bits will only leave the router at rate
<code>Rc</code>, giving an end-to-end throughput of
<code>Rc</code></p></li>
<li><p>To summarize, the throughput is always the minimum of
<code>{ Rc, Rs }</code>, a.k.a. transmission rate of the
<code>bottleneck link</code></p></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose that you are downloading an MP3 file of
<code>F = 32 million bits</code>, the server has a transmission rate of
<code>Rs = 2 Mbps</code>, and you have an access link of
<code>Rc = 1 Mbps</code></li>
<li><code>min{ Rs, Rc } = 1 Mbps</code>, therefore the time to download
will be <code>(32*10^6)/(1*10^6) = 32 seconds</code></li>
<li>If there are <code>N</code> links, the throughput will still be
<code>min{ R1, R2, R3... RN }</code>. This is always the case.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is
typically the access network.</p></li>
<li><p>But what if the rate of the common link is of the same order as
Rs and Rc?</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose <code>Rs = 2 Mbps</code>, <code>Rc = 1 Mbps</code>,
<code>R = 5 Mbps</code>, and the common link divides its transmission
rate equally among the 10 downloads</li>
<li>Now the bottleneck for each download is no longer in the access
network, but is now instead the shared link in the core, which only
provides each download with <code>500 kbps of throughput</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protocol-layers-and-their-service-models">1.5 Protocol Layers
and Their Service Models</h2>
<h3 id="layered-architecture">1.5.1 Layered Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>layered architecture</strong> allows us to discuss a
well-defined, specific part of a large and complex system</li>
<li>For large and complex systems that are constantly being updated, the
ability to change the implementation of a service without affecting
other components of the system is another important advantage of
layering.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="protocol-layering">Protocol Layering</h4>
<ul>
<li>To provide structure to the design of network protocols, network
designers organize protocols–and the network hardware and software that
implement the protocols in <strong>layers</strong></li>
<li>Each protocol belongs to one of the layers</li>
<li>We are again interested in the <strong>services</strong> that a
layer offers to the layer above–the so-called <strong>service
model</strong> of a layer.</li>
<li>Each layer provides its service by (1) performing certain actions
within that layer and by (2) using the services of the layer directly
below it</li>
<li>A protocol layer can be implemented in software, in hardware, or in
a combination of the two</li>
<li>Application-layer protocols–such as <strong>HTTP</strong> and
<strong>SMTP</strong> are almost always implemented in software in the
end systems</li>
<li>One potential drawback of layering is that one layer may duplicate
lower-layer functionality. For example, many protocol stacks provide
error recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis.</li>
<li>A second potential drawback is that functionality at one layer may
need information (for example, a timestamp value) that is present only
in another layer; this violates the goal of separation of layers.</li>
<li>When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called
the <strong>protocol stack</strong>. The Internet protocol stack
consists of five layers: the physical, link, network, transport, and
application layers</li>
<li>We take a <strong>top-down approach</strong>, first covering the
application layer and then proceeding downward</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="application-layer">Application layer</h4>
<ul>
<li>The application layer is where network applications and their
application-layer protocols reside</li>
<li>The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, such as
the <strong>HTTP</strong> protocol (which provides for Web document
request and transfer), <strong>SMTP</strong> (which provides for the
transfer of e-mail messages), and <strong>FTP</strong> (which provides
for the transfer of files between two end systems)</li>
<li><strong>domain name system (DNS)</strong> is an application layer
protocol</li>
<li>An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end
systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to
exchange packets of information with the application in another end
system</li>
<li>We’ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer
as a <strong>message</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="transport-layer">Transport Layer</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages
between application endpoints</li>
<li>In the Internet, there are two transport protocols,
<strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>UDP</strong>, either of which can
transport application-layer messages</li>
<li><strong>TCP</strong> provides a connection-oriented service to its
applications</li>
<li><strong>TCP</strong> also breaks long messages into shorter segments
and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles
its transmission rate when the network is congested</li>
<li>The <strong>UDP</strong> protocol provides a connectionless service
to its applications</li>
<li>This is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no flow
control, and no congestion control this transport-layer packet will be
referred to as a <strong>segment</strong> in the book</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="network-layer">Network Layer</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Internet’s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer
packets known as <strong>datagrams</strong> from one host to
another</li>
<li>The Internet transport-layer protocol (<strong>TCP</strong> or
<strong>UDP</strong>) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment
and a destination address to the network layer</li>
<li>The Internet’s network layer includes the celebrated IP protocol,
which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems
and routers act on these fields</li>
<li>There is only one <strong>IP</strong> protocol, and all Internet
components that have a network layer must run the <strong>IP</strong>
protocol</li>
<li>The Internet’s network layer also contains routing protocols that
determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and
destinations</li>
<li>Although the network layer contains both the <strong>IP</strong>
protocol and numerous routing protocols, it is often simply referred to
as the <strong>IP layer</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="link-layer">Link Layer</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Internet’s network layer routes a datagram through a series of
routers between the source and destination</li>
<li>To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in
the route, the network layer relies on the services of the <strong>link
layer</strong></li>
<li>In particular, at each node, the network layer passes the datagram
down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node
along the route</li>
<li>At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the
network layer.</li>
<li>Examples of link-layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, and the
cable access network’s DOCSIS protocol</li>
<li>The network layer will receive a different service from each of the
different link-layer protocols. In this book, the link-layer packets are
called <strong>frames</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="physical-layer">Physical Layer</h4>
<ul>
<li>While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one
network element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical
layer is to move the <strong>individual bits</strong> within the frame
from one node to the next</li>
<li>The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further
depend on the actual transmission medium of the link (for example,
twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics)</li>
<li>For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for
twisted-pair copper wire, another for A coaxial cable, another for
fiber, and so on</li>
<li>In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different way</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encapsulation">1.5.2 Encapsulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the sending host, an <strong>application-layer</strong> message
is passed to the transport layer</li>
<li>The application-layer message and the transport-layer header
information together constitute the <strong>transport-layer
segment</strong></li>
<li>The transport-layer segment thus <strong>encapsulates</strong> the
application-layer message</li>
<li>The transport layer then passes the segment to the network layer,
which adds network-layer header information such as source and
destination end system addresses, creating a <strong>network-layer
datagram</strong></li>
<li>The datagram is then passed to the link layer, which will add its
own link-layer header information and create a <strong>link-layer
frame</strong></li>
<li>Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields:
header fields and a <strong>payload field</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>payload</strong> is typically a packet from the layer
above.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="networks-under-attack">1.6 Networks Under Attack</h2>
<ul>
<li>A compromised host may also be enrolled in a network of thousands of
similarly compromised devices, collectively known as a
<strong>botnet</strong></li>
<li>Many malware can <strong>self-replicate</strong>. once it infects
one host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the
Internet</li>
<li>Another broad class of security threats are known as
<strong>denial-of-service (DoS)</strong> attacks</li>
<li>A DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of
infrastructure unusable by legitimate users. Web servers, e-mail
servers, DNS servers (discussed in Chapter 2), and institutional
networks can all be subject to DoS attacks</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability attack</strong> - This involves sending a few
well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system
running on a targeted host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to
a vulnerable application or operating system, the service can stop or,
worse, the host can crash</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth flooding</strong> - The attacker sends a deluge of
packets to the targeted host–so many packets that the target’s access
link becomes clogged, preventing legitimate packets from reaching the
server.</li>
<li><strong>Connection flooding</strong> - The attacker establishes a
large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections (TCP connections
are discussed in Chapter 3) at the target host. The host can become so
bogged down with these bogus connections that it stops accepting
legitimate connections</li>
<li>In a <strong>distributed DoS (DDoS) attack</strong>, illustrated in
Figure 1.25, the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source
blast traffic at the target</li>
<li>DDoS attacks leveraging botnets with thousands of comprised hosts
are a common occurrence today</li>
<li>DDos attacks are much harder to detect and defend against than a DoS
attack from a single host</li>
<li>When using LAN or Wifi, users are sending and receiving packets
which can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including
passwords, social security numbers, trade secrets, and private personal
messages, the book later mentions that all of this is usually encrpyted,
this is important because most of the sniffed data is unreadable. A
passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by is
called a <strong>packet sniffer</strong></li>
<li>Packet-sniffing software is freely available at various Web sites
and as commercial products i.e. Wireshark</li>
<li>The ability to inject packets into the Internet with a false source
address is known as <strong>IP-spoofing</strong></li>

<h2 id="history-of-computer-networking-and-the-internet">1.7 History of
Computer Networking and the Internet</h2>
<h3 id="the-development-of-packet-switching-1961-1972">1.7.1 The
Development of Packet Switching: 1961-1972</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first published work on packet-switching techniques was that of
Leonard Kleinrock [Kleinrock 1961; Kleinrock 1964] , then a graduate
student at MIT.</li>
<li>Using queuing theory, Kleinrock’s work elegantly demonstrated the
effectiveness of the packet-switching approach for bursty traffic
sources.</li>
<li>In 1964, Paul Baran [Baran 1964] at the Rand Institute had begun
investigating the use of packet switching for secure voice over military
networks, and at the National Physical Laboratory in England, Donald
Davies and Roger Scantlebury were also developing their ideas on packet
switching.</li>
<li>J. C. R. Licklider [DEC 1990] and Lawrence Roberts, both colleagues
of Kleinrock’s at MIT, went on to lead the computer science program at
the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the United States.</li>
<li>Roberts published an overall plan for the ARPAnet [Roberts 1967],
the first packet-switched computer network and a direct ancestor of
today’s public Internet.</li>
<li>On Labor Day in 1969, the first packet switch was installed at UCLA
under Kleinrock’s supervision, and three additional packet switches were
installed shortly thereafter at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI),
UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah (Figure 1.26)</li>
<li>By 1972, ARPAnet had grown to approximately 15 nodes and was given
its first public demonstration by Robert Kahn. The first host-to-host
protocol between ARPAnet end systems, known as the network-control
protocol (NCP), was completed [RFC 001].</li>
<li>With an end-to-end protocol available, applications could now be
written. Ray Tomlinson wrote the first e-mail program in 1972.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proprietary-networks-and-internetworking-1972-1980">1.7.2
Proprietary Networks and Internetworking: 1972-1980</h3>
<ul>
<li>The initial ARPAnet was a single, closed network.</li>
<li>In order to communicate with an ARPAnet host, one had to be actually
attached to another ARPAnet IMP.</li>
<li>In the early to mid-1970s, additional stand-alone packet-switching
networks besides ARPAnet came into being:
<ul>
<li>ALOHANet, a microwave network linking universities on the Hawaiian
islands [Abramson 1970]</li>
<li>DARPA’s packet-satellite [RFC 829] and packet-radio networks [Kahn
1978]</li>
<li>Telenet, a BBN commercial packet-switching network based on ARPAnet
technology</li>
<li>Cyclades, a French packet-switching network pioneered by Louis
Pouzin [Think 2012]</li>
<li>Time-sharing networks such as Tymnet and the GE Information Services
network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>among others, in the late 1960s and early 1970s [Schwartz 1977];
IBM’s SNA (1969â€“1974), which paralleled the ARPAnet work [Schwartz
1977].</li>
<li>Pioneering work on interconnecting networks (under the sponsorship
of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)), in essence
creating a network of networks, was done by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn
[Cerf 1974]</li>
<li>Early experimentation with TCP, combined with the recognition of the
importance of an unreliable, non-flow-controlled, end-to-end transport
service for applications such as packetized voice, led to the separation
of IP out of TCP and the development of the UDP protocol</li>
<li>The three key Internet protocols that we see
today–<strong>TCP</strong>, <strong>UDP</strong>, and
<strong>IP</strong>–were conceptually in place by the end of the
1970s.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-proliferation-of-networks-1980-1990">1.7.3 A Proliferation of
Networks: 1980-1990</h3>
<ul>
<li>By the end of the 1970s, approximately two hundred hosts were
connected to the ARPAnet</li>
<li>By the end of the 1980s the number of hosts connected to the public
Internet, a confederation of networks looking much like today’s
Internet, would reach a hundred thousand</li>
<li>The 1980s would be a time of tremendous growth</li>
<li>BITNET provided e-mail and file transfers among several universities
in the Northeast</li>
<li>CSNET (computer science network) was formed to link university
researchers who did not have access to ARPAnet</li>
<li>In 1986, NSFNET was created to provide access to NSF-sponsored
supercomputing centers</li>
<li>1983 saw the official deployment of TCP/IP as the new standard host
protocol for ARPAnet (replacing the NCP protocol)</li>
<li>The transition [RFC 801] from NCP to TCP/IP was a flag day event–all
hosts were required to transfer over to TCP/IP as of that day</li>
<li>In the late 1980s, important extensions were made to TCP to
implement host-based congestion control [Jacobson 1988].</li>
<li>The DNS, used to map between a human-readable Internet name (for
example, gaia.cs.umass.edu) and its 32-bit IP address, was also
developed [RFC 1034].</li>
<li>in the early 1980s the French launched the Minitel project, an
ambitious plan to bring data networking into everyone’s home.</li>
<li>he Minitel became a huge success in 1984 when the French government
gave away a free Minitel terminal to each French household that wanted
one</li>

<h3 id="the-internet-explosion-the-1990s">1.7.4 The Internet Explosion:
The 1990s</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1991, NSFNET lifted its restrictions on the use of NSFNET for
commercial purposes</li>
<li>NSFNET itself would be decommissioned in 1995, with Internet
backbone traffic being carried by commercial Internet Service Providers
(ISPs)</li>
<li>The main event of the 1990s was to be the emergence of the World
Wide Web application, which brought the Internet into the homes and
businesses of millions of people worldwide</li>
<li>The Web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee between 1989 and
1991 [Berners-Lee 1989], based on ideas originating in earlier work on
hypertext from the 1940s by Vannevar Bush [Bush 1945] and since the
1960s by Ted Nelson [Xanadu 2012].</li>
<li>Berners-Lee and his associates developed initial versions of HTML,
HTTP, a Web server, and a browser–the four key components of the
Web.</li>
<li>Around the end of 1993 there were about two hundred Web servers in
operation, this collection of servers being just a harbinger of what was
about to come.</li>
<li>At about this time several researchers were developing Web browsers
with GUI interfaces, including Marc Andreessen, who along with Jim
Clark, formed Mosaic Communications, which later became Netscape
Communications Corporation [Cusumano 1998; Quittner 1998]</li>
<li>By 1995, university students were using Netscape browsers to surf
the Web on a daily basis.</li>
<li>In 1996, Microsoft started to make browsers, which started the
browser war between Netscape and Microsoft, which Microsoft won a few
years later [Cusumano 1998].</li>

<h4 id="popular-applications-of-the-late-90s">Popular applications of
the late 90s</h4>
<ul>
<li>E-mail, including attachments and Web-accessible e-mail</li>
<li>The Web, including Web browsing and Internet commerce</li>
<li>Instant messaging, with contact lists</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer file sharing of MP3s, pioneered by Napster</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-new-millenium">1.7.5 The New Millenium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since the beginning of the millennium, we have been seeing
aggressive deployment of broadband Internet access to homes–not only
cable modems and DSL but also fiber to the home, and now 5G fixed
wireless</li>
<li>This high-speed Internet access has set the stage for a wealth of
video applications, including the distribution of user-generated video
(for example, YouTube), on-demand streaming of movies and television
shows (e.g., Netflix), and multi-person video conference (e.g., Skype,
Facetime, and Google Hangouts). Literally no one used Google Hangouts
fuckin’ liar.</li>
<li>Many Internet commerce companies are now running their applications
in the â€œcloud”–such as in Amazon’s EC2, in Microsoft’s Azure, or in
the Alibaba Cloud. Many companies and universities have also migrated
their Internet applications (e.g., e-mail and Web hosting) to the
cloud.</li>
